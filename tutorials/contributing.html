      Edit on GitHub
    </a>
    <p>Your contributions to the project are very welcome. If you would like to fix a bug or propose a new feature,
      you can submit a Pull Request.</p>
    <p>To help us merge your Pull Request, please make sure you follow these points:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Please make your fix on a separate branch. This makes merging much easier.</li>
      <li>Do not edit files <code>handsontable.js</code>, <code>handsontable.css</code>,
        <code>handsontable.full.js</code>, <code>handsontable.full.css</code>.
        Instead, try to edit files inside the <code>src/</code> directory and then use <code>grunt</code>
        to make a build.</li>
      <li>Very important: For any change that you make, <strong>please try to also add a test case(s)</strong>
        in <code>tests/jasmine/spec/</code> or <code>src/3rdparty/walkontable/test/jasmine/spec/</code>.
        This helps us understand the issue and make sure that it will stay fixed forever. See
        <a href="tutorial-testing.html">testing</a> for more detailed information.</li>
      <li>Describe the problem in the Pull Request description (of course you would do it, why do I mention that?)</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Thank you for your commitment!</strong></p>
