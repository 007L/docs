    <p>
      <strong>Handsontable</strong> is a JavaScript component for creating Excel-like data grids in modern web apps.
      Its virtual rendering engine express the idea of playing with big amount of data without worrying
      about performance issues. You will it easy to learn and use, however if you stuck with something,
      don't hesitate to ask on Google Group or open a new issue on GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      This documentation is organized into categories that express our learning curve.
      We suggest you start from Getting started section that will give you a good idea what Handsontable is and what powers it has.
      In the next step read Developer guide which show how to dive into more complicated topics.
      Handsontable doesn't require high programming skills but if you need a custom cell renderer
      or other complicated modification you may need help.

      <strong>Handsontable is still in progress so your feedback is very appreciated.</strong>

    <h1 id="building-your-own-handsontable">Building your own Handsontable</h1>

    <p>The build process is done using <strong><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a></strong> tool and bunch of Grunt
      tasks that are defined in <a href="https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/blob/master/package.json">package.json</a>.
    </p>

    <p>During the build process, the source files located in directory <code>src/*</code> are transformed into output
      files:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>./dist/handsontable.js</code></li>
      <li><code>./dist/handsontable.css</code></li>
      <li><code>./dist/handsontable.full.js</code></li>
      <li><code>./dist/handsontable.full.css</code> (more info about dist packages <a
        href="https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/tree/master/dist">here</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is advised that you never modify the above files but rather make changes in the <code>src/</code> directory
      and then run a proper build. This is especially important if you want to contribute your changes back to
      Handsontable using a pull request.</p>

    <h2 id="grunt-tasks">Grunt tasks</h2>

    <p>Currently, the following tasks are available for building Handsontable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>grunt</code> - runs a single build</li>
      <li><code>grunt watch</code> - watches for changes in source directory and runs a build when a change is observed
      </li>
      <li><code>grunt --force default watch</code> - runs a single build and then watches for changes</li>
      <li><code>grunt test</code> - runs a single build followed by Jasmine test suite executed in PhantomJS. Note that
        there is a known issue when running PhantomJS on Node.js 0.10.0. If you experience this problem, try to
        downgrade to Node.js 0.8.22, delete &quot;node_modules&quot; directory and call &quot;npm install&quot; again.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can create your own tasks by editing <code>Gruntfile.js</code></p>

    <h2 id="running-your-first-build">Running your first build</h2>

    <p>To run your own build, follow the below steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Install Node.js (available for Windows, Mac and Linux). This will also install NPM (Node Package Manager) that
        handles all the dependencies. Handsontable was tested with Node.js 0.8.20
      </li>
      <li>Clone Handsontable repository on your local disk and go to the directory where you cloned it</li>
      <li>Install Grunt CLI as a global NPM module (<code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code>). More about that on <a
        href="http://gruntjs.com/getting-started">Grunt - Getting Started</a></li>
      <li>Run <code>npm install</code> to download all the dependencies defined in <code>package.json</code>. The
        dependencies will be downloaded into a new directory <code>node_modules</code>, that is ignored by Git
      </li>
      <li>Run <code>grunt</code> to make your first build!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If it works correctly, you should see something like:</p>

    <p>To enable the merge cells feature, set the <code>mergeCells</code> option to be <code>true</code> or an
      array. To initialize Handsontable with predefined merged cells, provide merged cells details in form of an
      array: <code>mergeCells: [{row: 1, col: 1, rowspan: 2, colspan: 2}]</code></p>
