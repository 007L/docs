    <p>Materials in this section are to provide you with comprehensive knowledge on different parts of Handsontable and its
      dependencies in a structured manner. For those with moderate experience in development for whom the learning curve may
      be a bit steep we keep this documentation simple and unequivocal. Every chapter comes with corresponding example and piece
      of code depicting any given aspect of building upon already existing code.</p>
    <p>From conceptual point of view this library is not a finished product. We put a lot of work into keeping this data grid
      well maintained but if you still experience rough edges, just open a new GitHub issue about it.</p>
    <p>To start hacking on Handsontable start from "Data binding" section which explains nuances of connecting Handsontable
      with any data source of your choice.</p>

    <h3>Basics</h3>
    <p>As a new user you'll probably need to know more on how to connect Handsontable with your data source, what is the easiest
    approach to customize the layout and how to integrate it with 3rd party apps and libraries.</p>

    <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
    <p>As for the current version (0.13.0) Handsontable is not mobile-friendly component. Although the basic functionality works
    fine with iPad 4 but it's still experimental distribution. We aim to make Handsontable much more responsive but we expect
    that happens not until December 2015.</p>

    <h3>Become proficient and contribute</h3>
    <p>If your project require deep customization of Handsontable you may be interested in learning more about rendering engine,
    performance issues and testing procedures. Sometimes it would be great to incorporate your changes into the next official
    version of Handsontable so if you will to contribute to this project don't forget to make pull requests.
