    <p>Materials in this section are to provide you the comprehensive knowledge on different parts of Handsontable and its
      dependencies in a structured manner. For those with moderate experience in development for whom the learning curve may
      be a bit steep we keep this documentation simple and unequivocal. Every chapter comes with corresponding example and piece
      of code depicting any given aspect of building upon already existing code.</p>
    <p>From conceptual point of view this library is not a finished product. We put a lot of work into keeping this
      well maintained but if you experience rough edges, just
